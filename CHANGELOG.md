# Changelog

## 1.1.4

- Fixed: leader auto-unlocks session for proxied tool calls from followers (workflow gate blocked write tools in cluster mode)

## 1.1.3

- Fixed: follower now promotes to leader when leader process dies (checked every heartbeat)
- Fixed: query cache entries expire after 30s to prevent stale reads after CLI reindex
- Promotion starts the dashboard and claims the leader file automatically

## 1.1.2

- Fixed: `sylvan remove` now commits deletes (data wasn't persisting across runs)
- Fixed: `sylvan remove` on nonexistent repo shows clean message instead of traceback + hang
- Fixed: `remove` command in CLI docs

## 1.1.1

- Fixed: CLI indexing now waits for background tasks (embeddings, summaries) before exiting — no more lost embeddings
- Fixed: `sylvan library add` same issue
- Added: `sylvan remove <name>` command to delete an indexed repo and all its data
- Added: `drain_pending_tasks()` helper in context module
